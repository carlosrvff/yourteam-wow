* Teamwork
+ Take ownership. You are the CEO of your work. If you become a CEO one day, do not forget us.
+ Ask for help if needed. But search in Google first.
+ There is no individual team member's delivery. Only team's delivery.
* Meetings
+ Try to stay awake during our meetings.
+ Before scheduling a meeting, ask yourself if it could be an email.
+ If you think the meeting is not relevant to our team, watch a [[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2575988/][Silicon Valley]] episode instead.
* Communication
+ Raise a problem as soon as you see it. Call 911.
+ Respect each other and understand differences in knowledge.
+ There are no silly questions. Ask. We can extend any discussion.
