* Code Reviews
Code Reviews destroy human relationships for at least 10 years. So, be careful doing it.

This is the behavior we expected from you:
+ Make your comments positive and oriented to improving the code. You are a nice person, not a hater.
+ Prefer questions over statements. It will help you when you are wrong.
+ Suggest, not demand.
